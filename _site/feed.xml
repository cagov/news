&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done/doing is a recap of what we’ve done this week and what we have in our sprint plan for the week ahead. This post covers the week of May 4-May 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today marks the return of our weekly done/doing posts. Our focus with COVID19.CA.gov has been, relentlessly, on accessibility and performance. This commitment is reflected in every aspect of our team’s daily work. To date, we’ve made 6,200 commits in GitHub, 99% of those work done by our team (the remaining  1% courtesy of bots pitching in to do their part). As always, this site is a work in progress, and we continue to strive to do more, and do better to help Californians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Launched a round of feedback on &lt;a href=&quot;http://usertesting.com/&quot;&gt;usertesting.com&lt;/a&gt; across different gender, age and income levels to better understand how people&#39;s knowledge and information needs have changed from 1 month ago. Conducted 15 interviews on both mobile and computer to look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://covid19.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;covid19.ca.gov&lt;/a&gt;, to understand where users get their information, and to look through the site for comprehension, usability and general design.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Launched a special ux survey with 70 responses to get feedback on the speed accessibility content and design&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Soft launched site with Vietnamese, Tagalog, Korean and Arabic translations. This is in addition to the already live browseable in human translated English, Spanish, Traditional and Simplified Chinese.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Created several options for a redesign of the homepage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Created design for the new resilience roadmap page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited page content for most pages in English published this week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authored posts in WP, especially for urgent changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborated on homepage redesign, roadmap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated meta-descriptions for appropriate top pages to include &quot;shelter in place&quot; and &quot;seniors&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Making search improvements: Adding questions and answers relevant to internal searches so that we can quickly surface specifically what a user needs. We have a prototype of this now, will iterate and compare it with vendor solutions next week before choosing and shipping what best serves users&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Implementing redesign changes in phases&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Documenting COVID design standards&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Developing masks content&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Finding where content has aged between Stages 1 and 2&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Alpha.CA.gov product release 3</title>
    <link href="http://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-product-release-3/"/>
    <updated>2020-03-11T08:50:34.571-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-product-release-3/</id>
    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://news.alpha.ca.gov/img/thumb/Cover-Release-3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;A complete list of all Alpha.CA.gov user stories.&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;A complete list of all Alpha.CA.gov user stories.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the Alpha.CA.gov initiative wrapped up this past Friday with the release of eight new prototypes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apply for a discounted phone service&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;Check your tap water quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find shelters near you&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Contact a state agency&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Prepare for a wildfire&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Considerations after a wildfire&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sign up for local emergency alerts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Apply for unemployment insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As with our prior releases, this third and final release is the product of research, experimentation and iteration. In this release, we shipped the most stories in the shortest period of time. We wanted to show the value of at least creating initial prototypes, emphasizing the fact that we should always be iterating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the research and experimentation front, we tried a few new methods for getting user feedback, including a new online tool and expanded in-person testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online tool allowed us to connect with Californians across the state from a mix of socio-economic backgrounds, varying levels of tech savvy (and non-savvy) as well as other criteria like “previously evacuated due to a wildfire or other natural disaster” to get feedback on our disaster prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also prioritized in-person research and feedback including soliciting friends and family feedback on water quality. One of the most surprising outcomes from this testing was that every person we talked to had, at one time, checked their water quality. Whether it was because they were using it to mix baby formula or because they grew up in a place where tap water was unsafe, it was a surprising number of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognize that the n (the number of people talked to) in research like this is small but the chance to have the opportunity to ask “why” or “can you tell us more” in 30-minute, in-person interviews is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;These interviews allowed us to get at a deeper understanding of the questions people have around water, the work-arounds they use to try and figure out their water quality, and why this is such an important user need to focus on.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Our in-person research also taught us that when working with disaster preparedness, response, or recovery, each person’s experience is SO unique to their situation that it’s hard to get feedback that can be universalized and turned into a standard experience for users. But we embraced every piece of feedback and the prototypes that we offer in this release are intended to be iterated on and improved to become more relevant to people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through this process helped clarify for us the role government plays in providing information. It also gave us insights into the challenges and possible approaches to sharing information relevant to each person’s individual situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the last prong in our expanding user research efforts, we’re circling back with everyone who submitted their email in the initial survey (about 85 people). We will send the alpha.ca.gov site to them to ask for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our dev/tech team also really expanded on some best practices and brought some deep learnings to their work in this sprint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team used a Cricket Wireless’ Icon phone to test everything on low-end hardware. Making this part of our process exposed interesting new bugs and highlighted how important our existing focus on performance is. Being able to see render issues and interaction lag on a real device made it possible for each team member to actually see and feel the sub-par experience users on these devices have when surfing the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is critical given the fact that our team all use the most recent or prior release Apple or Android phones. And that when we make performance improvements the impact on high-end devices is minimal but is dramatic on low-end phones like the Cricket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing our dev team was really excited about this sprint was beginning to publish our own web components to power customized widgets, which really improved quality. We were able to hammer out interaction and accessibility improvements and install updates easily across multiple sites.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;We’re working on a separate blog that wraps up the Alpha phase and provides several, really interesting takeaways and learnings. Stay tuned for that later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all of our work, these newest prototypes are presented to you as works in progress. We welcome your feedback to make them better.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;h2&gt;Homepage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We asked users for their feedback on how best to group prototypes. The final groupings reflect the feedback from these users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;iterated homepage&lt;/a&gt;  
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Check if you can get a discounted phone service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User story: As a low income person, I need LIFELINE SERVICES, so that I can stay connected and communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our assumption: It’s imperative that we build services for all people and all devices. Californians that use Lifeline Services are often eligible for other social services. We assume that prioritizing this need will reveal other services to tackle. We want to test if this is the case and if this content and format makes sense to folks that depend on these services.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues/64&quot;&gt;GitHub issue #64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Screenshot of current Lifeline Services baseline.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested and iterated multiple prototypes, including:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Screenshot of Alpha.CA.gov design prototype for “Check if you can get a discounted phone service”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User feedback and takeaways included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Oh next, what’s next. Oh it didn’t do anything because I was supposed to click on something. That’s good.”&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;“Until you explained it a little bit more it wasn’t clear that I should go through it step by step. I would recommend hiding the other steps. Start with ‘if you can go to a discount.’” (This comment helped reinforce that “check elgibility” was its own need.)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“I like that it explains what a household is.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“It is all easy to read but not intuitive to go to step #2.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check out the iterated “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpha.ca.gov/check-if-you-can-get-discounted-phone-service/&quot;&gt;Check if you can get a discounted phone service&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Check your tap water quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;User story: As a Californian, I need to know my WATER QUALITY, so I can know if it&#39;s safe to drink.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;lil&gt;Our assumption: Water safety and accessibility is one of California&#39;s most significant issues. We assume that informing Californians of the quality of the water they drink is a need and one that is not currently being met. We sought to answer two questions: where does my water come from and what is my water quality? We then wanted to point people to a place where they could learn more. We hope to test if addressing these questions gets us closer to meeting the need.&lt;/lil&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues/90&quot;&gt;GitHub issue #90&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Screenshot of the current CA.gov “Check your tap water quality”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested and iterated three prototypes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;http://news.alpha.ca.gov/img/thumb/Water-Prototype-Safe-to-drink-v2-S.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Alpha.CA.gov design prototype for “Check your tap water quality.&quot;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Screenshot of Alpha.CA.gov design prototype for “Check your tap water quality.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

	&lt;img src=&quot;http://news.alpha.ca.gov/img/thumb/Water-Prototype-Unsafe-to-drink-v2-S.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Alpha.CA.gov design prototype for “Check your tap water quality.&quot;&gt;
	&lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Screenshot of Alpha.CA.gov design prototype for “Check your tap water quality.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User feedback and takeaways included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Call out is confusing”&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;“What is that unit?”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“Who is the authority on water?”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“Would have preferred zip look-up because I&#39;m lazy, glad it auto populated”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“Who is responsible if my water tastes funny?”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“How is it determined how it&#39;s tested?”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“How do I know to trust California?”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Going to state of CA, feels like asking Monsanto if corn is safe”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check out the iterated “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpha.ca.gov/check-your-tap-water-quality/&quot;&gt;Check your tap water quality&lt;/a&gt;” page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
	
&lt;h2&gt;Find shelters near you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;User story: As a person looking for temporary housing, I need to know where I can find my nearest SHELTER, so that I have a roof over my head.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Our assumption: With access to housing at a crisis point here in California, making it easier to find shelters would be helpful, a value add and worth testing. There are many situations that could force a person to have to find a shelter - and as far as we could tell there is not a robust state data source for this information.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues/102&quot;&gt;GitHub issue #102&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Baseline: there isn&#39;t anything comparable (that we could find)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We ran out of time to test before shipping, but our product owner chose to launch recognizing that this prototype is not done, and we know there’s a need to test and iterate.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check out the iterated “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpha.ca.gov/find-shelters-near-you/&quot;&gt;Find shelters near you&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Contact a state agency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;User story: As someone who wants to know information about government organizations, I want to be able to find details and CONTACT INFORMATION for the organization I want to connect with.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Our assumption: We assume that people are looking for state entity contacts. This will test the best way to share the state directory with Californians. And it will test any other content types we should consider when bucketing state entity information.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues/65&quot;&gt;GitHub issue #65&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cold.govops.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;Baseline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	
	&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;

		&lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Screenshot of the current CA.gov “Prepare for a wildfire&quot; page.&quot;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Limited bandwidth meant that we ended up testing this prototype internally with Alpha team staff members.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Check out the iterated “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpha.ca.gov/contact-us/&quot;&gt;Contact a state agency&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prepare for a wildfire and Sign up for local emergency alerts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;User story: As a person who knows an emergency could happen, I need to know what TOP TEN emergency prep things I need, so that I can feel more prepared.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Our assumption: We want to test if the public will trust the guidance/considerations in this content type. This is particularly focused on preparing for a wildfire. We want to learn what resonates with people.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Additionally: One of the first things that became clear as we worked on the user story is that signing up for local emergency alerts should be a stand alone step prototype.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues/98&quot;&gt;GitHub issue #98&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested and iterated one prototype:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;http://news.alpha.ca.gov/img/thumb/Prepare%20Wildfire-Prototype-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Prepare for a wildfire&quot; prototype.&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;&quot;Prepare for a wildfire&quot; prototype.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User feedback and takeaways included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Wishes for graphics to be more clear”&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;“Know alert is by county”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“Some you have to do in order, like you need a plan before you practice it”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“All are important steps; leave in this order but make sure it makes sense in the order”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“Doesn’t really understand how the content/steps are ordered”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“How do I know this has accurate info”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“Design is off-putting almost looks like an ad, feels too sophomorish”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Choose a family communication - really liked this step”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check out the iterated “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpha.ca.gov/prepare-for-wildfire/&quot;&gt;Prepare for a wildfire&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpha.ca.gov/sign-up-for-local-emergency-alerts/&quot;&gt;”Sign up for local emergency alerts&lt;/a&gt;” pages&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done/doing is a recap of what we’ve done this week and what we have in our sprint plan for the week ahead. This post covers the week of February 17-February 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in the middle of the final sprint of the Alpha. We’ve got seven new user story prototypes on deck that we’re user testing, iterating and improving on, and auditing ahead of release. Track our progress on Github issue #387.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Why Alpha.CA.gov is prioritizing APIs</title>
    <link href="http://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-APIs/"/>
    <updated>2020-02-21T09:14:23.101-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-APIs/</id>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;img src=&quot;http://news.alpha.ca.gov/img/thumb/APIs-Blog-Postman-Screenshot-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Alpha.CA.gov API Postman repository&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;A screenshot of the Alpha.CA.gov API Postman repository&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we kicked off Alpha, we did not expect to develop a suite of APIs. But as we started tackling user stories, we realized that many of them required the same data. So we iterated - and adopted an API first approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-are-application-programming-interfaces&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;, or application programming interface, is a tool that allows different products and services to talk to each other without having to know how they’re built or implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without APIs, government data can be challenging to work with for users outside of academia or government. APIs help make sense of what are often massive amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APIs are a critical component of the open data value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, APIs are the “yes, and...” of open data. Yes - open data is incredibly valuable... and APIs are what make it possible for any developer to access and build on that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APIs provide a level of accessibility that makes government more accountable and, ultimately, more effective and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating open APIs is a normal part of the development process in both the private and public sectors. And our team’s “API first” approach incorporates a couple of iterations on the public sector version of this norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our APIs are built for public use - and our code and development process is open to the public from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re the first user of our APIs. We’ve tested, iterated and improved every API we’re building. We’re making sure they’re user friendly and ready for even more rigorous testing and improvement by the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, underlying all of this is the belief championed by our dev team, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/carter-medlin-b1839b15//&quot;&gt;Carter Medlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronhans/&quot;&gt;Aaron Hans&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadbratton/&quot;&gt;Chad Bratton&lt;/a&gt;, and our Product Designer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukefretwell/&quot;&gt;Luke Fretwell&lt;/a&gt; that: California’s data belongs to the people of California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe deeply that APIs are essential to make data both available and accessible to the people of California. Building APIs is a logical step in our team’s work to make information and services simpler and more easily accessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.alpha.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt;, take them for a test drive and help us iterate and improve on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done/doing is a recap of what we’ve done this week and what we have in our sprint plan for the week ahead. This post covers the week of February 10-February 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shipped Release 2 with several new stories, translated into 3 languages&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;User tested water and lifeline prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Drafted initial set of human centered behavior archetypes to inform our design&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prototyped a guide to apply for unemployment insurance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Iterated with the team on a tool to check your tap water quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterated on a comprehensive guide to apply for California LifeLine, a discounted phone service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to Chad, we now have a great end-to-end testing suite that covers every page on our site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built a working prototype of “Check if my water is safe” tool and took it out for an initial round of user testing. This identifies the water system associated with an address and returns the violation history. We also built a couple of APIs to support this. (More coming on this in Release 3.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;User testing lifeline prototype at a local market with our friends from CHHS Office of Innovation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Taking in and iterating on user feedback on the California LifeLine prototype&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Researching wildfire preparedness, recovery, and cleanup; and prototyping related user stories&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Retrieving homeless shelter data for a new API&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Prototyping a new content type for unemployment insurance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Building out the ‘Contact us’ directory&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Always learning, always iterating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s 10 weeks into the Alpha and we’re excited to be releasing three new prototypes: “Apply for a Cal Grant,” “Apply for disability insurance benefits,” and “Check lane closures for your trip.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each of the new prototypes, we assessed the data, applied intuition, tested assumptions, listened to users, iterated, and improved. Learned, iterated and improved. And repeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team did several rounds of user testing on each prototype. This included testing the Cal Grant prototype at a Davis, CA charter school where the students provided great, actionable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were so impressed with these students. They all had applied to four-year universities. And we learned that it’s really up to them to navigate the process for applying to grants, scholarships and loans. We also learned that many high school students don’t often interact with state government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw this as an opportunity to demonstrate the power of agile government - responsive and user focused. The prototype responds directly to the feedback the Davis students provided, like the need for extra clarity on certain key points like deadlines. It makes the Cal Grant process clearer and easier to understand for students already navigating a complex environment.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Testing with highschoolers - and really with every user interview we’ve done - we’ve learned that by sharing our prototypes with even just a few people, we’re able to uncover some basic assumptions that we can quickly iterate on in our initial designs.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Continuing on the theme of always iterating, we’ve made both significant, and small, updates to the Release 1 prototypes. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We changed our food bank prototype to call our new API, which is now pulling from an augmented food bank collection. We built on the work of existing CfA food finder applications (thank you for the data!) and augmented that dataset with additional sources. The shortcomings of our initial data coverage were kindly pointed out by CfA employee and friendly hacker &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomdooner&quot;&gt;Tom Dooner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;We created an automatic update for the State holidays prototype.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We simplified the accordion content module HTML structure to align with best practices and improve accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We improved the step-by-step content module’s HTML structure for better structure and accessibility. One of the accessibility fixes included preventing the user from tabbing inside an unopened step item that was causing the loss of the user’s position on the page.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We added a sentence to step 2 of the “Hire a licensed contractor for home improvements” prototype. A small and significant iteration that made it clearer what projects need to get a building permit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the dev/tech side, we’ve also been doing and learning a lot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We automated performance and accessibility checks baked into the release pipeline (something our dev team is stoked about). &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/Alpha/issues/37&quot;&gt;#37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;We open source packaged, installable, reusable, and accessible versions of a couple of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cagov/step-list&quot;&gt;UI widgets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We made some really solid improvements to our translation processing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/Alpha/issues/228&quot;&gt;#228&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We built several new &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.alpha.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt; (more to come on this soon). &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/API/issues/12&quot;&gt;#12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/API/issues/9&quot;&gt;#9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/API/issues/17&quot;&gt;#17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;For example /WaterSystem identifies which water system service area contains a geographic point. This is one of the prerequisites for compiling the water quality testing data that’s tied to water system IDs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the three new prototypes, this second release includes one new language - Chinese and our first multi-page story. These prototypes also represent the first time we’ve iterated with color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A moment on the subject of color: It’s a constant source of conversation among the team. Everyone has ideas - much like we imagine you do. We certainly have heard from users about our black and white prototypes. “Dull” and even “depressing” has been among the feedback. Many users emphasized that California is about color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came up enough that we felt it was necessary to address it. It’s worth noting, though, that we did so with reservations. Simply put: Color can be a distraction, a rabbithole sapping time and effort from the goal of providing accessible, easy to use information and services. But the feedback has been clear - and we’re committed to iterating. We hope to capture feedback from a wider pool of users with this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the first release, these prototypes are very much a collaborative effort that benefit from the work already being done at the department level to generate better and more easily accessed information for users. A huge shout out to the Caltrans team for being so willing to work with us to reimagine one of Caltrans’ most popular services. Every prototype is a great reminder to us of how incredibly important it is to work with subject matter experts early and often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With just three weeks left to go in the Alpha sprint, we’re pushing harder than ever to realize the vision we laid out in our product framing.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Alpha is not the replacement for CA.gov. Our goal is to use the power of digital to deliver the services that any given Californian knows they need, as well as those services they might qualify for, and need, but not be aware of. See our updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-product-framing/&quot;&gt;Product Framing&lt;/a&gt; for more on this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all of our work, these new prototypes are works in progress. We welcome your feedback to make them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Apply for a Cal Grant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User story: As a new student applying to college, I need to apply for a CAL GRANT, so that I can get financial aid to go to college.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 2 is the deadline for students to apply for a Cal Grant. We wanted to test what language resonates with students and assumed they would want less detail.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User feedback and takeaways included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If a student has already completed the FAFSA, save them from even clicking into Step 1, move them to Step 2. One senior thought she may have to apply to FAFSA again. We could clarify this.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;Help distinguish between grant, scholarship and loan, and clarify that it&#39;s from the State (yes, Cal Grant implies this) but it was clear there is A LOT of information these kids handle and they are doing this part on their own. Most parents are involved with the FAFSA but then the rest, it seems, the kids manage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Apply for disability insurance benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;User story: As a worker, I need to know how to file for DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS so that I can maintain an income while I&#39;m out of work.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User feedback and takeaways included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wording is not clear. She prefers it to say, “Do you qualify?” because it is more focused on the goal of the tab.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;“My experience getting insurance is fine, but when trying to reach a person you have to come in-person and wait. When I had a password problem I came here to fix it. They said they fixed it and to wait 8 min. It still was not fixed. When I came back he said he couldn’t help me, but helped someone else who came later instead.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;First bullet - “This is not in the right flow because it says it will stop then it talks about receiving it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Check lane closures for your trip&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;User story: As a driver, I need to know the CONDITION OF THE ROADS so that I can stay safe.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This was an interesting one. The assumption was that people get the road information they need from Google Maps or other navigation apps. But in our initial research, we found that there’s a data gap between what Google displays and real-time Caltrans road closures. We even saw some cases where people were being routed onto closed roads.&lt;/li&gt;
	
	&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;http://news.alpha.ca.gov/img/thumb/Release-2-Road-Conditions-Road-Closure.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AA road sign on Highway 88 referencing the fact that road closures on 88 aren&#39;t included in the information navigation apps provide currently.&quot; &quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;A road sign on Highway 88 referencing the fact that road closures on 88 aren&#39;t included in the information navigation apps provide currently.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;We wanted to test how building an API could help the user experience by providing more accurate data that is not always reflected in their mapping app of choice. This story tests road closures and road conditions. It is not scoped to access data outside California’s border. It also tests a way to display map data in an accessible format. &lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues/37&quot;&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Done/doing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done/doing is a recap of what we’ve done this week and what we have in our sprint plan for the week ahead. This post covers the week of January 27-February 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Took a field research trip to a fire-impacted town where we brainstormed with a group of highschoolers to inspire future designs around disaster preparedness and recovery. We also met with a local elected and business owner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researched drinking water safety and the application process for unemployment insurance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Met with the good folks at the Franchise Tax Board to learn about quarterly taxes and their UX practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documented and shipped new API endpoints to retrieve food banks, CHP Incidents, Full Road closures by location. These are viewable &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.alpha.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototyped a transaction landing page to apply online for a discounted phone service. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues/64&quot;&gt;GitHub issue.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published the web components we use in our design system to npm. Check out our accordion component &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cagov/accordion&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved our road conditions prototype that lets you enter a destination and returns all known issues on your route. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues/37&quot;&gt;GitHub issue.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed some build issues with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marketplace/actions/eleventy-action-plus-rss&quot;&gt;GitHub action&lt;/a&gt; that allows us to automatically build and publish this blog to our github pages powered site when content is updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added google sheets translation formula to provide initial machine translations of our content (thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nsylianteng/status/1221124367163318275/&quot;&gt;Twitter user @nsylianteng!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streamlined the core ceremonies (stand-ups, retrospectives, and sprint planning) to improve overall communications within the Team, particularly for our remote colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synthesizing stories and insights from our field research&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Scraping additional data sources to augment our food bank data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue user testing the road conditions prototype and the application process for disability insurance&lt;/li&gt;	
&lt;li&gt;Researching emergency preparedness, debris removal, emergency alerts, burned car removal, and the emergency recovery process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User stories on disability insurance and Cal Grants are being promoted from user testing prototypes to the live site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with water system boundary areas and water testing data to create APIs and prototype user stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing research to find contact information for new user story to help people connect with state agencies and departments. Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues/65&quot;&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Lessons learned translating Alpha.CA.gov release 1</title>
    <link href="http://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-spanish-translation/"/>
    <updated>2020-01-28T13:22:44.906-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-spanish-translation/</id>
    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://news.alpha.ca.gov/img/thumb/En-espanol.jpg&quot; class=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of a sticky note that says &amp;quot;En espanol.&amp;quot;&quot; &#39;=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you noticed that the first release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpha.ca.gov.com/&quot;&gt;Alpha.CA.gov&lt;/a&gt; prototypes included Spanish language versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something we’re particularly proud of. Given our timeline and resources, these translations were initially out of scope for the first release. But they were always front of mind for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/abquirarte&quot;&gt;Angie&lt;/a&gt;, our product owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angie is a Mexican immigrant and Spanish is her first language. Growing up, Angie and her family spoke Spanish at home. Speaking a language other than English at home is something that over 40% of Californians also do. And, it&#39;s worth noting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.languageline.com/report-california-limited-english-proficient&quot;&gt;“18.6% of California residents are considered limited English proficient (LEP), meaning they speak English less than ‘very well.’”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw this in practice when we user tested the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.ca.gov/services/request-birth-certificate/&quot;&gt;Find a birth certificate&lt;/a&gt; prototype in the field: 3 out of 5 people were at the county office with translators because Spanish is their primary language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This IRL reminder of California’s incredible cultural diversity inspired us to expand our scope and push to make Spanish translation part of release 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;During the translations process, we tested for:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Quality/Accuracy of translation API tools&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Level of effort to validate translations (by asking at least 3 native-Spanish speakers)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Level of effort from the team, overall&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Content design from English to Spanish considerations&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Domain considerations&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Level of interest from real users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;We learned a lot:&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;h3&gt;Doing the translations forced us to revisit the English version to make it clearer, more accurate.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The English titles and section descriptions are spare, concise. In Spanish, those same titles and section headers are far more conversational.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;As we translated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.ca.gov/services/hire-licensed-contractor-home-improvements/&quot;&gt;Hire a Licensed Contractor&lt;/a&gt; page, we realized that the English version was not as clear as we thought it was. Doing the Spanish translation actually helped us iterate and improve the English version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Verbatim translations don’t work.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When thinking about service design, translation is not as simple as verbatim translation. You have to do the work to provide context and create translations that convey accurate, literal and cultural meaning in both English and Spanish.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.ca.gov/about/&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page, in English, reads: “We&#39;re a small but mighty team of public servants and outside experts in user research and design.” In Spanish, it says: “Somos un pequeño equipo de servidores públicos y expertos en el diseño centrado en el usuario y tecnología.” “Small but mighty” has a different connotation in Spanish because the word “mighty” translates to “powerful,” connoting a stronger tone that does not feel as welcoming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Finding materials in Spanish proved challenging - and so did translations of more technical content.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There was no baseline Spanish translation available for the “More details about holidays” section on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.ca.gov/services/state-california-employee-holidays/&quot;&gt;State holidays&lt;/a&gt; page. Without the help of a subject matter expert in that language, it was hard to know if we were using the correct terminology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Even when available, the baseline content in Spanish was not always reliable because it had been translated using auto translate apps, which offer essentially verbatim translation. This meant additional vetting and reworking on our end to provide the appropriate context, tone, and wording we want to convey
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the work we did to translate the first several prototypes was a heavy lift for our small but mighty team, and likely not scalable for the Alpha given our timeline and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s important to emphasize that looking to the future, CA.gov will be multi-lingual in ways that reflect our learnings. That is, with an emphasis on and prioritization of cultural competency over verbatim translation. It&#39;s up to us (on the government side) to always keep in mind that context matters and some technologies are not 100% reliable when it comes to designing for our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Please test this work in progress!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a very busy, very productive six weeks for our team. (Even despite the holiday season!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve documented in our weekly “Done/doing” blogs, we’ve begun to build the proverbial plane, even as we’re approaching cruising altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, we have: configured our instances of GitHub, GSuite and Slack - tools not widely used in California state government. Gotten our cloud environment up and running ( thanks to a huge lift from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CADeptTech&quot;&gt;CDT&lt;/a&gt;). Established initial &lt;a href=&quot;https://handbook-cadotgov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;workplace norms, ceremonies and workflows, design and operational principles&lt;/a&gt;. Bootstrapped a web design architecture, developed and tested prototypes (including this new blog, which is open source and 100% accessible). Said “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CAdotGov/status/1204814757624086528%22&quot;&gt;Hello California!&lt;/a&gt;” Begun the ongoing process of gathering, researching and prioritizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CAdotGov/status/1202723639423950849&quot;&gt;user needs&lt;/a&gt;. Pushed out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CAdotGov/status/1207797255643766785&quot;&gt;first user survey&lt;/a&gt;. Gotten a sample SMS text up and running. Collaborated with, learned from, and greatly appreciated working with our state partners in our research, testing and fact checking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ramp up was chaotic at times, like any start up. We’ve hit plenty of speed bumps along the way — and have plenty of learnings to share:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing a culture of collaboration and actually getting to know each other as people, from the outset, are among the most important things we’ve done. And while we’re still learning how to work together and trying to figure out the simple things like finding the right temperature for the office (a work in progress), we have a solid foundation for navigating and resolving conflict.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;We can’t emphasize enough how critical Sprint 0 (our planning and logistics sprint) was for building a foundation before kickoff. Finding and setting up the office, hiring staff, figuring out the right number of chairs we &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; need, working with legal to vet tools, and other basic operational needs are a huge undertaking and, often, underestimated.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Launching an alpha just before the winter holidays is not an optimal timeline. Doing the kick-off during the holidays meant that roles and responsibilities have had to shift in order to keep up momentum while team members were away. This heightened what was already proving to be a challenge around operationalizing our workflows to figure who’s doing what, when, and what the hand off of tasks between teams members looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in the agile way has also proven to be a challenge. It’s fundamentally different from how state government typically operates — and it’s a new way of working for most of us (see building the plane metaphor above). At the same time, many of us are learning new tools, most notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, which we’re using as our primary workflow management tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant challenge has been scaling up our user testing. User research is a newer discipline for the State. The status quo currently depends on operationalizing untested assumptions of what we think people need. We are trying to set a new way of work in this alpha, but as a result, none of the basics were in place when we got started. For example, there was no legal template for participant consent for qualitative user interviews. And we still don’t have the ability to compensate people for the time they spend talking to us and sharing their stories (we’re working on it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other minor but impactful challenges have slowed our roll at points. Things like not having electricity for the first week, working around partners’ availability for fact-checking user stories, and procuring new tools and subscriptions (always takes longer than anticipated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be posting more about our challenges and learnings in the weeks ahead. But the most important learning we can offer at this point is: when it comes to creating user-focused digital services, there is no such thing as “done,” or “final.” There are always iterations and improvements that can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s in that spirit that we share our &lt;a href=&quot;http://alpha.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;first product release&lt;/a&gt; with you.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;These seven new prototypes — a homepage, find your minimum wage, request a birth certificate, find official California state holidays, hire a licensed contractor for home improvements, and find food banks near you — are a work in progress. They’re iterations on where we started. They’ve been user tested (to the extent possible) and improved based on that feedback and will continue to be tested and iterated on. They’re not meant to be perfect, and we need your feedback to help make them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prototypes are as accessible as possible (each scores 100 on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/____lighthouse?lang=en&quot;&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;). AAnd none exceed a 6th grade reading level. In these critical ways, they provide simpler, clearer, faster access to state government information and services.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ll give us feedback so that we can continue to learn, test, iterate and improve these pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, we’ve tried to capture a before/after for each user story, as well as some of the user feedback we captured testing the prototypes. A complete account of each user story can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/cagov/projects/2&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User feedback &amp; takeaways included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We learned that while the statewide minimum wage is a certain amount, some cities and counties set their own rate which is not always easy to find.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;“More info on the page would be helpful.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Why provide the city look up when it says “statewide?”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Less isn’t always enough.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User feedback &amp; takeaways included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We went to the county office and observed people trying to get their birth certificate. We learned that people didn’t know they had to bring their ID or make the request at the county of birth.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;“I like the first one better. You can see all the info first and then see the link. Showing the cost is a good idea, seeing the wait time is good.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Having the word ‘cost’ is needed and ‘wait time’ is helpful.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“I like the button to be more at the bottom.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We learned that listing the holidays is not as simple as listing the dates, particularly if the some of the holidays and holiday time off fall on weekends.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;“I definitely like the upcoming holiday feature.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Link to add calendar looks out of place, breaks up the text in an odd way.”&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;“I assume it would take me somewhere more in-depth.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“The link icon under #2 looks more official, seems to show authority. The “press button” icon appears more simple.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We listed 211 as another resource assuming that if people were looking for food banks, they would also look for 211 services. When tested, people didn’t know what 211 was. We found this to be an opportunity to inform people of other services that they may obtain.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;“Looks nice and simple, I’d make text bigger. I mean, I know people know how to enlarge on screen to make bigger…”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Needs housing info.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Looks good. Could use some visuals, like what the places look like. Could use a picture to go with it. Would look up using zip code.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work this week has been focused on releasing our first round of prototypes. As we speak, we’re elbows deep in the final push to finish Spanish translations, domain name clean up, purging the CDN, troubleshooting cache issues, QAing, and a million other critical details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/Alpha/issues/93&quot;&gt;GitHub Issue Alpha #93&lt;/a&gt; to see how we’re organizing our work and sprinting to the release.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Alpha.CA.gov product framing (Updated 02/10/20)</title>
    <link href="http://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-product-framing/"/>
    <updated>2020-01-21T10:20:34.628-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-product-framing/</id>
    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://news.alpha.ca.gov/img/full/product-framing.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Product framing&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Product framing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product framing helps our team think about and focus on the problem we’re here to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While product framing documents are not typical in an Alpha, we created it to encourage our team to think in new terms, ask questions and learn as we go. It provides a rubric against which we can measure our progress and our learnings. And it informs and guides us at every level of our work as we research, prioritize, test, design, code, iterate, iterate, and iterate again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Problem statement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of California need information and services offered by the State of California. Currently, California state government digital information and services are disparate, spread across multiple domains and websites. Each state organization manages its content and experience differently, causing a lack of cohesiveness, findability, accessibility, security, and performance across all California government websites. This lack of organization leads to a lack of trust and low satisfaction from the people we intend to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users often rely on unofficial, third-party resources to find official state services and information because they can’t find what they are looking for on current official government websites. This can lead to further distrust among users when it comes to the authenticity of the information or service they’re seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;It’s essential that there be a unified, verifiable source of official state information optimized for delivery, focused on delivering services and information for the people of California.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Product vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to create a better digital experience for users. Our vision for doing that is to create a unified, trusted, online presence for State government. This vision is built on incremental iterations starting with improving search of online government services and information, to making user research and product design core functions of service design, and, most importantly, soliciting and taking action on feedback from Californians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha is the first iteration of a better digital experience. CA.gov will ultimately show the people of California that their government is committed to meeting the needs of the people of California. The experience will be simpler, clearer, faster, and more accessible for all Californians searching for state government information and services. They will recognize CA.gov as the official California state government website. It will give them the comprehensive state government information and services that they seek. The public will be able to find their services without knowing the names or acronyms of the related State organization or program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to use the power of digital to deliver the services that any given Californian knows they need, as well as those services they might qualify for, and need, but not be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What we want to learn&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How can user research and content design help meet user needs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What it takes for government to work in the open&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How to best set up a highly effective digital services team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What we’re not trying to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Redesign all of the State of California’s digital government services&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Set the State of California’s technology strategy&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Maintain traditional practices in digital or technology strategy and execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Product assumptions and dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;That people go first to their government official website to find what they’re looking for.
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That we understand what matters most to people&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;That the way users currently find government services online is their preferred method&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;That users don’t care about an agency-focused approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prioritization criteria for user needs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alpha will be based on initial user needs that are selected with data, intuition, and experimentation. The following criteria will be used to assess the overall impact of the user story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;External Criteria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Total reach (population)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Biggest area for improvement&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Level of complexity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Level of urgency&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Who (individuals or business)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Vulnerable populations&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Topical for Californians&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sensitive&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Positive, “wow-factor,” innovative&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Common or specific need&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ability to capture data analytics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Public facing issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Internal Criteria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Existing effort already in place&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Stakeholder priority&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Measurable impact&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Open/helpful departments&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Discrete part of information or service&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Long term, push to Beta&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Prototyped content for three user needs including Cal Grants, food banks, and finding a licensed contractor for home improvements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Iterated on content types within the draft design system&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Baselining the user needs to test for accessibility, speed, and readability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Packaging the initial user stories that have undergone user testing, making sure they meet our content, design, accessibility, and performance standards before publishing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Crafting an Emergency Preparedness survey&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Testing user story prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Drafting a Content Style Guide&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Developed MVP &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/cwds/issues/17&quot;&gt;design system&lt;/a&gt; and page templates&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Collected 50+ responses on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/AlphaCAgov&quot;&gt;general Alpha survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Guest team members (shout to CHHS Office of Innovation!) tested the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues&quot;&gt;State Holiday prototype&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to handle 4th of July and validated that we want to keep Next Holiday feature&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CAdotGov/status/1207440359782928384&quot;&gt;field research visit&lt;/a&gt; to Vital Records office in South Sacramento to test “Request a birth certificate” with guest team members from CHHS Innovation team&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Built new Function As A Service (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/FunctionApps&quot;&gt;FAAS&lt;/a&gt;, also called “serverless”) prototype and Github integrated deployment pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Setup &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/cwds/issues/3&quot;&gt;initial docs&lt;/a&gt; for our bootstrap based design system, rewrote first bootstrap interactive UI widget as a web component, allowing us to provide the same functionality with much smaller code footprint&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prototyped additional &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues&quot;&gt;user stories&lt;/a&gt;, augmented our minimum wage user prototype so it autocompletes all cities and zip codes in CA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Iterate on new content type templates so we can prototype user stories faster and cleaner&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Integrate accessibility testing tools into our code editors as automated linters, and into the CI pipeline as automated tests and into our browsers for manual testing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Design discussion guide for deep, qualitative research on victims of trauma and wildfire&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Begin development on the site functionality required for Alpha site to support user story content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

  &lt;img src=&quot;http://news.alpha.ca.gov/img/full/design-principles.jpg&quot; class=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Alpha.CA.gov design principles&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Alpha.CA.gov design principles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design principles help teams and stakeholders to align on design vision and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They give us a shared understanding to help us prioritize our next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our design principles, we are once again, leveraging the proven work and best practices of teams like 18F and the UK Government Digital Services. As our starting point, we’re adopting and iterating on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#start-with-user-needs&quot;&gt;design principles created by GDS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alpha.CA.gov design principles include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Start with user needs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do less&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Design with data, research, intuition, and experimentation (We added “research, intuition and experimentation” for a few reasons. Data doesn’t always tell the whole story. We also need user research, experimentation and, yes, our own intuition as users and Californians to inform design.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do the hard work to make it simple and elegant&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Iterate — then iterate again&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make it accessible and inclusive (UK.GOV went with “This is for everyone.” We adapted it to make it more explicit and reflect California.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Understand context&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Build digital services, not websites&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be consistent but not uniform&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make things open: It makes things better&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prioritize security, respect privacy (Something new we added to the list. A recognition of how incredibly important both security and privacy are.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Optimize performance (Another new one. Slow load times cost people money. That’s an accessibility and equity issue.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These principles will inform our product design. And we’ll continue to iterate and refine them as we learn by doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Alpha.CA.gov operational principles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our operational principles guide how our team works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They reflect our collaborative culture. And they inform our priority setting and decision making. These principles will inform our day-to-day work and big-picture planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing our practice of building on what’s been tried and proven before, we’ve adopted and adapted the U.S. Digital Service principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve made one adaptation. We added “Emphasize collaboration across teams” because collaboration is central and essential to our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how the Alpha Team works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Default to open&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Understand what people need&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Use data to drive decisions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Address the whole experience, from start to finish&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Make it simple and intuitive&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Build the service using agile and iterative practices&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Assign one leader and hold that person accountable&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Bring in experienced teams&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Emphasize collaboration across teams&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Choose a modern technology stack&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Deploy in a flexible hosting environment&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Automate testing and deployments&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Manage security and privacy through reusable processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll continue to iterate and refine these principles as we learn by doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Introducing the CA.gov Alpha Team</title>

    <id>http://news.alpha.ca.gov/introducing-the-ca-gov-alpha-team/</id>
    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Alpha.CA.gov team&quot; class=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://news.alpha.ca.gov/img/full/alpha-team.jpeg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Alpha.CA.gov team&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new team has a big job. We’re working to make it easier for Californians to access, understand and use digital information and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a job that each of us is incredibly excited to take on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are 11 Californians, passionate about this state and committed to making it better. We come from Mexico, the Ukraine, Riverside, San Francisco, Placerville and points in between. We are experts in our fields. And we believe that state government has to get better at using digital technology to serve residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a person, we are a little awed to have this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked everyone on the team why they wanted to be part of this alpha project, and here’s what they said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Angie Quirarte, Product Owner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Angie built the team, is setting the vision for the Alpha and will make sure we deliver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“We have an incredible opportunity to create a new way for government to inform, engage, and interact with the public by putting user research and design at the center of our work. It’s fulfilling to be part of a team that is genuinely invested in making a difference. Everyone is open to continuous learning, willing to experiment, and committed to re-imagining the digital experience of Californians with their government!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Luke Fretwell, Product Designer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luke is imagining what the Alpha might look and feel like to the user.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“California is my home. The chance to combine the work I’ve done professionally with the honor and privilege to serve my fellow Californians is an opportunity of a lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hilary Hoeber, User Researcher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hilary researches what Californians need from CA.gov.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“I joined this team because I am passionate about infusing research and human-centered design into government to reimagine how it shows up in the world, both online and offline. This feels like the right moment to circle back to my previous work in the public sector (as part of IDEO) after spending the past few years in the private sector. This unique opportunity gets me back to what I care about most deeply: understanding what matters most to people and amplifying their needs through design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rebecca Huval, Content Designer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rebecca will choose words that actually make sense to the people who use CA.gov.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“This project means so much to me. I’m honored to be here. I want to help Californians access the services and information they need. And I’m eager to grow and experiment alongside this talented team. I value writing that puts readers first, and that’s especially important in government. The right content can help people navigate their lives and feel heard, seen and respected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Aaron Hans, Tech Lead&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aaron makes web applications fast and accessible for all users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“It is a privilege to help make government a little more efficient. Our work on this project will stretch tax dollars and help users get served faster. I love civic tech. I lead the Water Quality project at the Open Oakland Code for America brigade. I helped build a startup that improves the purchasing process for local governments. I’ve admired Angelica’s work at GovOps for awhile and wanted to get on board this project. I want to raise the standard of online government services in California.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chad Bratton, Technical Architect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chad is building the scaffolding the site will run on, making sure all the pieces fit together seamlessly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“I am excited to help design and implement a new website and a new way of working that is accessible and focused on the user needs of California’s residents with a very perse team of designers, developers, researchers, and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Carter Medlin, Full-Stack Developer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carter codes. That’s his favorite thing in the world to do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“I want to be part of the Alpha team for the opportunity to learn new development technologies and methodologies by working with acclaimed experts from around the state. I look forward to having a lasting positive impact on the delivery of public services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Art Khomishen, Interaction Designer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art is responsible for using design to bring to life Hilary’s research, and Rebecca’s words.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&quot;I truly believe that in one’s professional life there are opportunities that come around only once in a great while. The CA.gov Alpha team and initiative is such an opportunity. The Alpha is going to be a challenge, full of unknowns and yet full of growth, inspiration, discovery, innovation, disruption and more. It is a privilege to be an agent of innovation and disruption in government — where change is not always embraced. The Alpha will be a catalyst for growth and innovation for everyone involved and more importantly for California’s ultimate stakeholders, the residents of this great state.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kimberly Glenn, Team Success &amp; Delivery Manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kimberly makes sure we have what we need to get stuff done.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to be part of the Alpha Team to improve services for the residents of California by creating a new way to work transparently that regains their trust in the California Government. The Alpha Team gives me the ability to bring together inpiduals from across the industry to create a solution for all Californians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JP Petrucione, Communications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JP puts our commitment to transparency and openness into practice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s rare that you get a chance to do work that will have a positive, measurable impact on so many people, so close to home. Luke got it right, for sure. This really is an opportunity of a lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Re-imagining CA.gov How Can California Government Better Serve its People?</title>
    <link href="http://news.alpha.ca.gov/re-imagining-ca-gov-how-can-california-government-better-serve-its-people/"/>
    <updated>2020-01-21T10:20:34.632-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://news.alpha.ca.gov/re-imagining-ca-gov-how-can-california-government-better-serve-its-people/</id>
    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;How might we?&quot; class=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://news.alpha.ca.gov/img/full/how-might-we.jpeg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;How might we?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, governments around the world have started asking themselves, “How can we use digital to better serve our people?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California government has also begun to test new approaches. We want to accelerate these efforts by re-imagining CA.gov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;CA.gov&lt;/a&gt; is the state’s official homepage. But more important, it should be the place where the people of California go to get the information and services they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vision is championed by the Governor’s Office and the leaders from the Government Operations Agency and the California Department of Technology. This is not business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make that happen, we plan to follow the example set by many of those other teams around the world, and start with a discreet prototype: an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works&quot;&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Product Owner for the CA.gov Alpha, my role is to lead a small team of public servants and outside experts in answering the fundamental question. How do we make sure that the digital information and services Californians need are easily accessed, intuitively understood and simply used?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our priority: ask and learn from what Californians’ need&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an approach that sounds like common sense. But for government, it is relatively new and often hard to accomplish. In fact, this approach has really only gained traction over the last decade, driven by the success of the UK Government Digital Service, which radically reimagined how government understands, builds and provides digital services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work that was started in Europe has turned into a movement, and spread to the US with the creation of government agencies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://18f.gsa.gov/&quot;&gt;18F&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://usds.gov/&quot;&gt;US Digital Service&lt;/a&gt; and NGOs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeforamerica.org/&quot;&gt;Code for America&lt;/a&gt;. And countries around the world have taken a leap to redesign the front door of their government, their homepages. In Peru, they created &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gob.pe/&quot;&gt;gob.pe&lt;/a&gt;. In Mexico it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gob.mx/&quot;&gt;gob.mx&lt;/a&gt;. In Israel there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.il/&quot;&gt;gov.il&lt;/a&gt;. And the Canadian province of Ontario created &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ontario.ca/page/government-ontario&quot;&gt;ontario.ca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples of what is truly a radical approach to digital information and services in the context of delivering government services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s radical because it starts by asking a basic question: what do users need? And it’s made even more radical when you consider that this approach answers that question, not by delivering a monolithic, final product that costs hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe works, maybe doesn’t — but rather by developing a discrete prototype that is improved and iterated on based on user feedback. There is value in the process of learning through open iteration because it ultimately makes government better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what we’re proposing to do here in California with CA.gov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Building on best practices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to follow the example and best practices established by the people who have done this before and that means starting with the alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thrilled to be working in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeforamerica.org/&quot;&gt;Code for America&lt;/a&gt;, which has helped define and build civic tech in the US; and with &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.digital/&quot;&gt;Public Digital&lt;/a&gt;, whose partners led the GOV.UK effort and founded the UK Government Digital Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also looking forward to tapping into the collective experience and expertise of the civic tech community. This will be extremely helpful for our team in the alpha phase and beyond, because it will allow us to leverage the incredible experience there to find and hire staff, apply user research, deploy human-centric design, develop a roadmap that puts into practice the iterative, agile, approach that’s at the heart of this work, and, ultimately, deliver a product built to be improved and iterated on in order to better serve the people of California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Speaking of improving and iterating ...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really important to note that we will be sharing lessons learned and how we work throughout the process. We will work in the open, be agile, work quickly, iterate, test, and learn as we build and improve the CA.gov Alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working this way sounds unorthodox — and it is, at least within government. But it’s a process that underpins the experiences we all have whenever we navigate the web. The platforms that we turn to every day to buy stuff, get rides from strangers, and find just about anything, were all built and continue to evolve based on this very same approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us here on the Alpha team, working in an agile and open way is essential to creating the opportunity to experiment and innovate in ways that embody the spirit of California and move us forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is only possible with a team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, in order to do any of this, we have to first build a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already identified a product owner, interaction designer, developer, technical architect, and team success manager. Over the coming months, these passionate, committed public servants, technologists and others will be working on an alpha that prioritizes user needs and shows how government can better use digital to better serve Californians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our multi-disciplinary team will be composed of staff from state agencies and outside subject matter experts in user research and design. It will be empowered to try new things to re-imagine how things are done in government. It will work in the open, documenting our progress (and yes, failures) as we design our product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post is the first step on this path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still assembling our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Think you might be interested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still looking for people who are as psyched as we are about our mission. Maybe you’re one of them. We are looking to contract or hire:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Technical Lead&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Delivery Manager&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;User Researcher&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Content Designer&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Product Designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://govops.forms.fm/interest-form-ca-gov-alpha-team/&quot;&gt;Learn more about these opportunities through this interest form.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;And in closing ...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the start. This is the first time we’re communicating about this effort, and we wanted to make sure that this post really drives home the incredible opportunity we have here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor Newsom’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenville%29&quot;&gt;“Citizenville”&lt;/a&gt; envisioned a government that better serves its people by better understanding their needs. And right now, there is no question that California is a state dealing with many needs and many challenges. We believe that a big part of meeting these needs and addressing these challenges starts by re-imagining CA.gov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://govops.forms.fm/interest-form-ca-gov-alpha-team/forms/7391&quot;&gt;Join this mission.&lt;/a&gt; Together we can fulfill the vision of a California for All.&lt;/p&gt;
